### UI and Styling

Component Libraries
- Use Shadcn UI for consistent, accessible component design.
- Apply composition patterns to create modular, reusable components.
- Use lucide react for all the icons
- whenever you want to use an icon, first import the icon in the src/components/ui/icons.ts file, import the icons file and then use the icon.

Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first, maintainable styling.
- Design with mobile-first, responsive principles for flexibility across devices.
- Implement dark mode using CSS variables or Tailwind’s dark mode features.
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards for readability.
- Maintain consistent spacing values to establish visual harmony.
- Define CSS variables for theme colors and spacing to support easy theming and maintainability.
- Use a mobile-first approach

### Shadcn UI Rules
- Use existing Shadcn components (`@/components/ui/*`) for UI elements.
- If a component doesn’t exist, suggest installing it with `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>`.
- Combine Shadcn components with Tailwind for custom styling.
