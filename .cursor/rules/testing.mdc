### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

### Unit Testing
    - Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components.
    - Use Jest and React Testing Library for reliable and efficient testing of React components.
    - Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert to ensure clarity and consistency in tests.
    - Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests.

### Integration Testing
    - Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality.
    - Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence.
    - Use snapshot testing selectively to catch unintended UI changes without over-relying on it.
    - Leverage testing utilities (e.g., screen in RTL) for cleaner and more readable tests.
