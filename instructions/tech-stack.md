# Tech Stack for Code Reviewer Web App

This document outlines the technologies and tools used to build the Code Reviewer Web App. The stack is designed to ensure a secure, scalable, and maintainable application while meeting all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
  - Handles server-side rendering, routing, and API routes for seamless integration with backend services.  
  - Version: 14.x (latest stable).

- **UI Components & Styling:**  
  - [Shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) for accessible, customizable UI components.  
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.  
  - [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for a consistent and modern icon set.  
  - [react-arborist](https://github.com/brimdata/react-arborist) for rendering the repository file tree with virtualized, accessible, and customizable tree view functionality.  
  - [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for seamless dark and light theme switching, integrated with Tailwind CSS for theme-aware styling.

- **Code Display:** [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)  
  - Provides syntax highlighting and a rich code viewing experience.  
  - Integrated via [react-monaco-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-monaco-editor) for React compatibility.

- **Authentication & Database:** [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)  
  - Manages user authentication via GitHub OAuth.  
  - Stores user data and review history in a secure, scalable database.  
  - Version: 1.x (latest stable).

- **AI Integration:** [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/)  
  - Powers AI-driven code review generation with custom prompts.  
  - Integrated via API calls from Next.js API routes.

## Additional Technologies

- **State Management:** [Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/)  
  - Lightweight state management for handling global states like selected repository and file.  
  - Chosen for simplicity and minimal boilerplate compared to Redux.

- **Data Fetching & Caching:** [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)  
  - Handles data fetching from the GitHub API with built-in caching and revalidation.  
  - Improves performance by reducing redundant API calls.

- **Animations:** [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)  
  - Provides smooth, high-performance animations for UI elements, such as transitions for column content, file tree expansion, and review panel updates.

- **Error Handling & Logging:** [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)  
  - Monitors and logs errors in real-time for both frontend and backend.  
  - Provides detailed error reports and performance monitoring.

- **Testing:**  
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit and integration testing.  
  - [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for component testing.  
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.

- **Utilities:**  
  - [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for  for date manipulation and formatting (e.g., review timestamps).  
  - [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for utility functions like debouncing and throttling.

## Development Tools

- **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for repository hosting.

- **Code Quality:**  
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting JavaScript/TypeScript code.  
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.  
  - [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality.

- **Environment Management:** [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)  
  - Manages environment variables for development and production.

## Deployment & Hosting

- **Hosting Platform:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)  
  - Deploys the Next.js application with automatic scaling and serverless functions.  
  - Integrates seamlessly with the Vercel AI SDK.

- **Database & Auth Hosting:** [Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/cloud) or self-hosted Appwrite instance  
  - Provides scalable backend services for authentication and database management.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication:**  
  - Appwrite handles secure session management and token storage.  
  - GitHub OAuth tokens are stored securely in Appwrite and never exposed to the client.

- **Data Protection:**  
  - Appwrite database collections are configured with role-based access controls.  
  - Sensitive data (e.g., review history) is encrypted at rest.

- **API Security:**  
  - Next.js API routes are protected with middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access GitHub data.  
  - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse of GitHub API and AI SDK.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching:**  
  - SWR caches GitHub API responses to reduce load times and API usage.  
  - Review history is cached locally to minimize database queries.

- **Lazy Loading:**  
  - Monaco Editor and react-arborist are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size.  
  - Large repository file trees are paginated or loaded on demand.

- **AI Request Optimization:**  
  - File content is preprocessed (e.g., truncated if too large) before sending to the AI SDK.  
  - AI requests are debounced to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.

## Summary

This tech stack provides a robust foundation for the Code Reviewer Web App, leveraging Next.js, Appwrite, and the Vercel AI SDK as core components. The addition of `react-arborist` ensures efficient rendering of the repository file tree, while `next-themes` enables seamless dark/light theme switching for an enhanced user experience. `GSAP` adds smooth animations for UI interactions, improving visual polish. Additional tools like Zustand, SWR, and Sentry enhance performance, reliability, and developer experience, while security and scalability are prioritized through Appwrite and Vercel. The inclusion of testing, code quality, and utility libraries ensures a high-quality, maintainable codebase.
